Reliquary
=========

The source code of Reliquary! That mod, with the magical swag, and a weapon, and stuff.

This mod has no affiliation with x3n0's original mod (pending response). So, I've decided to maintain the mod as a seprate entity from Xeno's Reliquary until I get permission to continue the offical mod, or I'll stop when Xeno comes back from hiatus and picks up developement again. But until then, I'll update the mod and add new features and such.

Versioning
=========

The mod currently is at v1.6.4-1.0. This is a direct port of Xeno's original commit to 1.6.4. I'll be adding stuff from later commits where I see fit, and will also being adding new features under a eventual v2.0 milestone. Version numbers are independent of MC versions, and MC versions are included solely as a convenience. 

Also, check issues for my version-to-version progress and roadmap leading to 2.0.

Licence
=========

The licence is located at COPYING.txt, but to save you the trouble, it's GPLv3. 

Basically, do whatever you want, as long as it's free, open source, and stays under GPL. (Yes, that allows you to use it in your modpack.)
